      <h2> A campus-specific, course-specific tutoring service for college students. </h2>
      <p> 
          pugChamp is a networking resource that allows college students to connect with peers at their university. 
      </p>
      <h2> tutor to student. student to tutor. </h2> 

      <p> 
        We hope to stabilize tutoring through providing opportunities to college students to help their peers, 
        as well as mentorship to students in need of help in specific courses. 
        We seek to streamline tutoring in course-specific tutor/student matching, providing an optimal 
        experience for both tutors and students.
